                <li>At just 5 years old, Michael joined his brothers to form the Jackson5.</li>
                <li>By age 8, he was the group's lead singer, displaying a "soul far older than his years".</li>
                <li>His father, Joe Jackson, was a demanding manager who used strict discipline -  and sometimes physical punishment -  to push the brothers toward success.</li>
                <li>The group signed with Motown Records in 1968 (with officially debut and first releases in 1996), soon achieving four consecutive #1 hits, including "I Want You Back" (1969) and "ABC" (1970).</li>
                <li>By age 11, he was a national sensation with "I Want You Back" (1969).</li>
